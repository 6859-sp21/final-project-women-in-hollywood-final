Abstract: We like to think of society as ever progressing. It is convenient and comfortable to think that time fixes all mistakes - and under this mindset, it is easy to believe that Hollywood has become better in its representation of a diverse array of people since its inception. In order to explore these assumptions, we utilize the Bechdel Test as a metric for assessing the representation of women within a movie. Through a series of interactive data visualizations that take the audience from any one movie in particular to the whole overarching trend of movies in a 40 year time span, we begin to understand the truth of our optimistic sentiments regarding Hollywood. Although it is true that women have become better represented in Hollywood over time, the magnitude of this upward change is disappointingly small. Thus, we conclude Hollywood still has a long way to go before it can provide an accurate reflection of modern-day feminist ideals in society.
