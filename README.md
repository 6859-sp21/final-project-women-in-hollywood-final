## An overview of our development process

This project is a continuation of our A4 visualization, which featured a linked line chart and bubble chart that explored a range of movies and whether or not each one passed the Bechdel Test. The work in total was spread out over the course of 6 weeks, and was split evenly between teammates. A more concrete breakdown is included at the end of this README. 

As our A4 visualization was very open-ended and featured a wide range of movies, we decided to add on to the project in order to create a martini-glass style narrative structure about the lack of representation of women in Hollywood films. As a result, we added: 
* a poll at the beginning of the visualization, meant to introduce users to the issue we are trying to address and to have them reflect on their own assumptions
* a short mini-quiz asking users to guess if a movie has passed the Bechdel Test out of ten highly grossing movies, with a corresponding bar graph placing their results against the average of previous players
* a visualization of the top ten highest grossing movies that failed the Bechdel Test over the span of twenty years
* a series of line graphs separating movies into genres and plotting the percentage of movies passing the Bechdel Test over the year

We added on our main A4 visualization at the end to encourage users to explore the dataset more freely, concluding our martini-glass structure. 


Jennifer worked on the following things: 
* The appearance/functionality of the poll and its results
* Constructing the miniquiz as a carousel
* The highest-grossing movies chart depicting blockbusters that have failed the Bechdel Test
* The content of the introduction and concluding section

Alvin worked on the following things:
* Setting up a database for the poll and the mini-quiz
* The initial structure of the miniquiz
* The series of line charts of movies broken down by genre
* The scrolly-telling, spaced out formatting of the visualization
