          <ul>
            <li><b>(1)</b> it has to have at least two women in it, </li>
            <li><b>(2)</b> who talk to each other, about </li>

        <p>Do you think Hollywood has improved its representation of women over the years?</p>
        <p>We think there's been some improvement, but it's clear that Hollywood has a long way to go. It's important to remember that the Bechdel Test has been around for more than thirty years now, and actually only needs three requirements to pass. In fact, the test itself has its own share of criticisms for being too simple or too limiting, among other factors. Nowadays, many people are seeking out newer, more up-to-date measures for evaluating the representation of women in movies, which includes considerations for race, sexuality, character arc, and more.</p>
